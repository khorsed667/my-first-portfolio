    <h1>WELCOME TO <br/>
    <span>PETER PARKER </span>WORLD</h1>
    <h3> A most popular child hero & also for me...</h3>
    
            <p>Ever since the undoing of Peter Parker and Mary Jane's marriage, the character of Spider-Man has been stuck in a bit of a limbo. We got to see Peter Parker go from high school to college to eventually married man. The natural progression of the character should have seen him become a parent before too. Unfortunately, the editors at Marvel didn't want to age Spidey too much, otherwise, he might lose some mainstream appeal.</p></br>

                 <P> Spider-Man is known amongst his crime-fighting peers and his diehard fans for a number of memorable traits that include his well-defined sense of responsibility and amazing abilities. However, he has also been known to drop a number of memorable quotes and motivational speeches over the years that have become iconic, so we'll be taking a look at a few more classic and modern sayings from the wall-crawler that fans won't soon forget.</P></br>
